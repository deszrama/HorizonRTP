# HorizonRTP
HorizonRTP is super lightweight minecraft plugin for random teleport with many functions that are constantly added and the plugin is updated. The plugin also includes a very simple configuration file that can be understood by anyone. The plugin is easy to upload and does not need any additional libraries. If you find any bug please report it, I will try to fix it as soon as possible!
